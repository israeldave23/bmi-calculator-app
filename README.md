A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The BMI (Body Mass Index) app is a tool that can help you understand if you're a healthy weight for your height.

You just need to input your height and weight into the app, and it will calculate your BMI. BMI is a number that indicates whether you're underweight, a healthy weight, overweight.

The app can be helpful for people who are trying to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. It can also be used by healthcare professionals to screen for potential weight-related health problems.

However, it's important to remember that BMI is just one indicator of health, and it doesn't take into account factors like muscle mass or body shape. It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before making any significant changes to your diet or exercise routine.
